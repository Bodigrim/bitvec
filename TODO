1. more coverage in tests
2. criterion benchmark suite
2b. compare criterion results to other bit-array libraries, speed things up if needed

Misc tasks not prioritized:
* clean up API
* separate the IntSet-like operations into new module Data.IntSet.Dense (maybe even new package depending on this one)
* expand/generalize 'vector-rope' package to support lazy and/or sparse vectors and generalize existing interface to support operating on sparse bit vectors and/or bit-vectors implemented on top of sparse word-vectors
* consider lobbying to have this code merged into vector and/or containers as "instance Unbox Bool" and IntSet (using the sparse rope versions hinted at above), respectively.
